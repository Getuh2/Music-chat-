            <p>The global music industry saw its 8th consecutive year of growth and was valued at $26.2 billion in 2022, according to the IFPI Global Music Report. Looking at global revenue shares, streaming took the majority with 67%, proving that it continues to dominate.</p>
            <p>Over the last year, streaming reached $17.5 billion, an 11.5% increase. This is a sharp contrast to downloads and other digital (non-streaming) forms, which decreased by 11.7%. The fastest growing region was Sub Saharan Africa, where music revenue increased by 34.7%, followed by Latin America with 25.9%. These regions, traditionally underbanked, are a prime example of the importance of diversifying payment services in digital content, so that customers can access them without credit cards being an entry barrier.</p>
            <p>According to Statista, global streaming revenue is projected to reach $31.4 billion. While looking forward, trends in streaming are starting to emerge. The popularity of streaming services has seen a rise in content exclusivity, such as unique content or pre-releasing new music, to attract and retain users.</p>
            <p>When discussing the music industry, we must talk about what people are listening to. As streaming and other digital methods allow music to be more global, local music is taking the spotlight. The ability to reach global audiences means that emerging markets are now opening to more significant investment in digital music and streaming services. Using local artists on streaming services means that people can connect with the artists that they love as more people switch to consuming digital music content.</p>
            <p>According to Juniper Research, big streaming brands are now being challenged by regional and national streaming platforms that offer more local music. Reaching users with the most attractive music content is paramount.</p>
